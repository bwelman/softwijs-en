<p>The <em>data model</em> was introduced in Excel 2010 together with the Power Pivot addin. From version 2013 the data model is fully embedded in Excel. A data model is an abstract model that organizes data in tables and can create relationships between tables.</p>
<p>Through <em>Get &amp; Transform</em>, formerly called <em>Power Query</em>, you can load data from multiple data sources in Excel. At the end of the import process you have the choice to load the data to a worksheet, to the data model or to both.</p>
<p>You do not always have this choice and that is caused by the default settings for loading queries. There are two ways for finding these settings:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>In Excel: tab Data &gt; Get Data (group Get &amp; Transform Data) &gt; Query Options</li>
<li>In Power Query Editor: File &gt; Options &amp; Settings &gt; Query Options</li>
</ol>
<p>In both cases you get</p>
<div class="figure">

<p class="caption">Power Query Options</p>
</div>
<p>With standard load settings, the data is loaded to a new workdheet when loading a single query. When you import two or more tables then a data model is created automatically. You can override these settings for a given query using the Load To dialog window.</p>
