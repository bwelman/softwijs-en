## Welcome

Welcome to the website from Softwijs and Ben Welman.

Softwijs was founded in 1993 with the aim of developing educational software for middle and higher education. In the nineties, training courses in the Microsoft Office applications were developed. Course materials have been developed in-house. All developers of this course material work in education or have worked in it. The textbooks differ from other books because of the large number of assignments in them, often directly from professional practice. For Microsoft Office only textbooks for Access and Excel are available.

### Main features

-  The textbooks **Access 2016** and **Excel 2016** are available in a **free online version**, both the Dutch- and English-language versions. The source files for these textbooks are *DITA* files, created and published with Oxygen XML Editor.
-  You can also buy these textbooks in PDF/EPUB format through Gumroad, see at *Textbooks* in the navigation bar at the left.
-  Older versions of the textbooks are only available on request.
-  There will be regular articles about:
   +   statistics and data-analysis with Excel and Power Query
   +   data analysis with R
   +   time series and forecasting
   +   creating reproducible analyzes and reports
